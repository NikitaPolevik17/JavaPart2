//  The following code creates one array and one string object.
//  How many references to those objects exist after the code executes?
//  Is either object eligible for garbage collection?

//  String[] students = new String[10];
//  String studentName = "Peter Parker";
//  students[0] = studentName;
//  studentName = null;

//      Answer:

//      Array students is not eligible for garbage collection because it has one reference to the object studentName

//      studentName is not eligible either because students[0] still refers to studentName

//      Non objects is eligible for garbage collection
